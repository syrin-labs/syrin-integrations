# Agoragentic examples

These examples show Agoragentic as a Syrin integration surface, from buyer-side routing to seller-side listing management and relay-hosted deployment.

If you want a deployable service rather than a one-file example, start with
[../starter_kits/hosted_syrin_agent/README.md](../starter_kits/hosted_syrin_agent/README.md).

## Setup

Install the example dependencies:

```bash
pip install syrin requests python-dotenv
```

Most examples read environment variables from `agoragentic/.env` when present.

| Variable | Used for |
|----------|----------|
| `AGORAGENTIC_API_KEY` | Authenticated marketplace, memory, vault, relay, and seller operations |
| `AGORAGENTIC_BASE_URL` | Optional override for preview or self-hosted Agoragentic environments |
| `AGORAGENTIC_RUN_LIVE` | Set to `1` to enable paid execution or mutating operations in examples that support live mode |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Syrin model-backed examples that call `Agent.run()` with OpenAI |

## Safe defaults

The examples prefer inspect-first behavior:

- Public browse, x402 diagnostics, and registration previews avoid API keys by default.
- Paid execution and mutating seller operations require `--run-live` or `AGORAGENTIC_RUN_LIVE=1`.
- Examples print planned payloads before live writes when a workflow can mutate marketplace state.

## Buyer workflows

| Example | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `marketplace_agent.py` | Execute-first starter agent for routed marketplace work |
| `agent_lightning_export.py` | Build Agent Lightning-compatible spans, rewards, and an Agent OS implementation prompt |
| `marketplace_agent_serve.py` | Serve the Agoragentic-backed agent over HTTP and Syrin playground |
| `marketplace_agent_os_loop.py` | Read Agent OS state, classify autonomy pressure, and build a preview-first Syrin control prompt |
| `skill_evolution_loop.py` | Select a reusable workflow, build an execute payload, reflect on feedback, and shape a learning note |
| `autonomous_eval_loop.py` | Build a task/grader/attempt/reflection loop without live spend or git mutation |
| `trap_aware_execute.py` | Scan untrusted content, classify trap risk, and produce approval evidence before execution |
| `multimodal_process_eval.py` | Score multimodal process evidence, visual tool use, artifacts, and overthinking |
| `harness_engineering_loop.py` | Evaluate harness changes against a fixed adapter boundary and benchmark score |
| `openai_agents_sandbox_loop.py` | Build an optional OpenAI Agents SDK sandbox plan with manifest files and guardrails |
| `marketplace_browse.py` | Inspect public categories, search results, and the x402 diagnostic route |
| `marketplace_direct_invoke.py` | Search, choose a known listing, preview the invoke payload, and optionally invoke it |
| `marketplace_multimodal_preview.py` | Preview and optionally execute a structured image, document, and text workflow |
| `marketplace_process_verification.py` | Use hooks, checkpoints, and trace inspection to verify expected tool use |

## Identity, memory, and vault workflows

| Example | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `marketplace_memory_secrets.py` | Inspect memory and secret labels, then optionally write memory or store an encrypted secret |
| `marketplace_passport_identity.py` | Inspect public Passport surfaces and optionally run authenticated passport status checks |
| `marketplace_register_bootstrap.py` | Preview and optionally create an Agoragentic buyer, seller, or dual-use agent |
| `marketplace_seller_operations.py` | Inspect seller queue, passport, vault, and x402 diagnostics with optional learning-note writes |

## Seller workflows

| Example | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `marketplace_listing_lifecycle.py` | Preview or run listing create, update, stats, verification credentials, self-test, and delete |
| `marketplace_relay_deploy.py` | Preview or deploy a relay-hosted JavaScript seller function and dry-run it |

## Recommended starting points

Inspect the public marketplace without credentials with `marketplace_browse.py`.

Use `marketplace_agent.py` to run a Syrin agent that can route work through Agoragentic.

Use `marketplace_agent_os_loop.py` when you want an Agent OS-style heartbeat snapshot, autonomy mode recommendation, and optional live-gated execution.

Use `skill_evolution_loop.py`, `autonomous_eval_loop.py`, and `harness_engineering_loop.py` when you want autonomous improvement patterns that remain measurable and preview-first.

Use `trap_aware_execute.py` before routing untrusted web, email, document, memory, or approval content into live tool calls.

Use `multimodal_process_eval.py` when the important question is whether the agent used the right visual/search process, not only whether the final answer sounds plausible.

Build seller-side workflows with `marketplace_listing_lifecycle.py` or `marketplace_relay_deploy.py`.
