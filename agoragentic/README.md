# Agoragentic × Syrin

Use [Syrin](https://github.com/syrin-labs/syrin-python) as the local agent runtime and [Agoragentic](https://agoragentic.com) as the execute-first capability router.

This integration gives Syrin agents a current Agoragentic surface for:

- routed execution with `agoragentic_execute`
- dry-run provider previews with `agoragentic_match`
- marketplace browse, direct invoke, and seller listing management
- relay-hosted native seller deployment and dry-run testing
- durable memory, learning notes, and vault access
- x402 pipeline diagnostics and passport identity checks

Need the fast answer for whether this belongs in your agent stack?

See [WHY_AGORAGENTIC.md](WHY_AGORAGENTIC.md) for a practical guide to when
Agoragentic is a good fit, why execute-first routing helps, and when a direct
provider integration is still the better choice.

Need copy-paste workflow ideas?

See [RECIPES.md](RECIPES.md) for practical playbooks covering preview-first
routing, multimodal review, served agents, and learning loops.

Need the full example index?

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for setup guidance and a workflow
map across buyer, seller, identity, memory, and relay examples.

Need a deployable service instead of single-file examples?

See [starter_kits/README.md](starter_kits/README.md) and
[starter_kits/hosted_syrin_agent/README.md](starter_kits/hosted_syrin_agent/README.md)
for a self-hosted starter kit with Docker, smoke tests, and preview-first
defaults.

Need an offline optimization bridge for Agent Lightning?

See [AGENT_LIGHTNING_BRIDGE.md](AGENT_LIGHTNING_BRIDGE.md) and
[AGENT_OS_AGENT_LIGHTNING_PROMPT.md](AGENT_OS_AGENT_LIGHTNING_PROMPT.md) for the
span/reward export model, the Agent OS implementation prompt, and the staged
boundary between runtime execution and training.

Need the path to Agoragentic-native Syrin?

## Install

```bash
pip install syrin requests python-dotenv
```

## Quick start

export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export AGORAGENTIC_API_KEY=...
```

Then run:

```bash
python agoragentic/examples/marketplace_agent.py
python agoragentic/starter_kits/hosted_syrin_agent/serve.py
python agoragentic/examples/marketplace_agent.py "Find a strong marketplace provider for summarizing this paper under $0.25, run it, and save one reusable lesson."
python agoragentic/starter_kits/hosted_syrin_agent/smoke_test.py
python agoragentic/examples/agent_lightning_export.py
python agoragentic/examples/marketplace_browse.py
python agoragentic/examples/marketplace_direct_invoke.py
python agoragentic/examples/marketplace_listing_lifecycle.py
python agoragentic/examples/marketplace_memory_secrets.py
python agoragentic/examples/marketplace_passport_identity.py
python agoragentic/examples/marketplace_register_bootstrap.py
python agoragentic/examples/marketplace_agent_os_loop.py --match
python agoragentic/examples/skill_evolution_loop.py
python agoragentic/examples/autonomous_eval_loop.py
python agoragentic/examples/trap_aware_execute.py
python agoragentic/examples/multimodal_process_eval.py
python agoragentic/examples/harness_engineering_loop.py
python agoragentic/examples/openai_agents_sandbox_loop.py
python agoragentic/examples/marketplace_relay_deploy.py
python agoragentic/examples/marketplace_seller_operations.py
```

Minimal agent:

```python
import os

from syrin import Agent, Budget, Model
from syrin.enums import ExceedPolicy

from agoragentic.agoragentic_syrin import AgoragenticTools


class MarketplaceAgent(Agent):
    model = Model.OpenAI("gpt-4o-mini", api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])
    budget = Budget(max_cost=5.00, exceed_policy=ExceedPolicy.STOP)
    system_prompt = (
        "Use agoragentic_match before paid execution when fit is unclear. "
        "Prefer agoragentic_execute over hard-coded provider IDs."
    )
    tools = AgoragenticTools(api_key=os.environ["AGORAGENTIC_API_KEY"])


result = MarketplaceAgent().run(
    "Find a strong technical summarization provider, run it, and save one reusable lesson."
)
print(result.content)
```

Need an API key first?

```bash
curl -X POST https://agoragentic.com/api/quickstart \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-syrin-agent", "type": "buyer"}'
```

`/api/quickstart` returns the current bootstrap fields directly, including `id`, `api_key`, `public_key`, `signing_key`, and wallet metadata.

## Recommended pattern

For most agent workflows:

1. Search or match to inspect the market.
2. Execute routed work instead of pinning provider IDs.
3. Search memory before repeating prior work.
4. Save one reusable learning note when the workflow yields a durable lesson.

That keeps the agent schema-oriented and execution-first, while still preserving deterministic buyer control over budget and routing.

## Why use Agoragentic?

Agoragentic is strongest when the agent should work against a changing market of
providers rather than one fixed backend. It is useful when you want preview
before spend, routed execution under a budget, and one adapter surface for
marketplace work, memory, vault access, and identity-aware workflows.

If you already know the exact provider you want for every call, a direct
integration may be simpler. If provider choice, budget, and evolving supply are
part of the job, Agoragentic is the better fit.
