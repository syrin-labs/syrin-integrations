# Intent Bus + Syrin Integration

Run Syrin agents as distributed workers. No open ports, atomic routing, built-in retries.

## Why Intent Bus?
* Workers poll outbound (no open ports required)
* Atomic claim semantics (at-least-once execution)
* Exponential backoff + dead-letter queue
* Lightweight SQLite backend
* State persistence between claims
* **Universal LLM routing (Native support for OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini + seamless adapter for OpenRouter, Groq, and local Ollama nodes)**

## When to Use
**✅ Good Fit:** Background AI agents, web scrapers, long-running research tasks, asynchronous code review bots.
**❌ Bad Fit:** Microsecond-latency microservices, real-time gaming backends, billions of events per second.

## Architecture & Ecosystem Comparison

| Tool | Core Philosophy | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intent Bus** | Lightweight, poll-based, zero-trust network friendly. | Decentralized AI agents, unreliable networks. |
| **Celery** | Heavyweight, broker-dependent (Redis/RabbitMQ). | Standard Django/Python monolith background tasks. |
| **Temporal** | Highly complex, durable execution state machine. | Enterprise financial transactions, massive orchestration. |

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install intent-bus syrin pyyaml
echo "your-bus-key" > ~/.apikey
echo "your-gemini-key" > ~/.geminikey

# Terminal 1: Start the worker
python worker.py

# Terminal 2: Dispatch a mission
python trigger.py "Analyze this code"
```

## Real Output Example
```text
